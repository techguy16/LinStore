# LinStore
The only app store you'll ever need on Linux, eventually.

## Installing Pi-Apps apps
LinStore will have support for apps from Pi-Apps (I'm sorry Botspot). 

<code>install_package</code> and <code>remove_package</code> are separate scripts, unlike Pi-Apps which uses a large script (<code>manage</code>) for everything.

## Architectures supported
* AMD64
> **We don't call it AMD64** - some anonymous person
* i386
* ARM64
* ARMv7l
