# AI Policy
Seriously, who cares? AI is becoming a big part of our lives and if you want to contribute, I don't really care as long as the code works. 

If you want to be extra careful, only use AIs listed here that have the status of "working".

AI | Status
---|-------
ChatGPT | <p style='color:green;'>Working</p>
Bing | <p style='color:red;'>Avoid</p>. Creates code that looks like it works but doesn't.
Google Bard | <p style='color:red;'>Avoid</p>. Creates code that looks like it works but doesn't.
